# Operators

## Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
Operator | Name | Description | Example |
---------|------|-------------|---------|
`+`	| Addition	| Adds together two values | `x + y` |
`-`	| Subtraction	| Subtracts one value from another | `x - y` |
`*`	| Multiplication | Multiplies two values | `x * y` |
`/`	| Division | Divides one value by another	| `x / y`	|
`%`	| Modulus	| Returns the division remainder | `x % y` |	
`++` | Increment | Increases the value of a variable by 1	| `++x`	|
`--` | Decrement | Decreases the value of a variable by 1	| `--x` |

## Assignment Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
Operator | Example | Same As |
---------|---------|---------|
`=` |	`x = 5` | `x = 5`	|
`+=` | `x += 3` | `x = x + 3`	|
`-=` | `x -= 3`	| `x = x - 3`	|
`*=`| `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3`	|
`/=` | `x /= 3` |	`x = x / 3`	|
`%=` | `x %= 3`	| `x = x % 3`	|
`&=` | `x &= 3`	| `x = x & 3` |
`|=` | `x |= 3`	| `x = x | 3`	|
`^=` | `x ^= 3`	| `x = x ^ 3`	|
`>>=`	| `x >>= 3`	| `x = x >> 3` |	
`<<=`	| `x <<= 3`	| `x = x << 3` |

## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
Operator | Name | Example |
---------|------|---------|
`==` | Equal to	| `x == y` |
`!=` | Not equal | `x != y` |
`>`	| Greater than | `x > y` |	
`<`	| Less than	| `x < y`	|
`>=` | Greater than or equal to | `x >= y` |
`<=` | Less than or equal to | `x <= y` |

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:
Operator | Name | Description | Example |
---------|------|-------------|---------|
`&&` | Logical and	| Returns true if both statements are true | `x < 5 &&  x < 10` |
`||` | Logical or	| Returns true if one of the statements is true	| `x < 5 || x < 4` |	
`!`	| Logical not	| Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	| `!(x < 5 && x < 10)` |
